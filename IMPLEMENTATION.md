Implementation Bootstrap

Purpose
- Record initial implementation plan and immediate next steps to start development.

Immediate tasks
1. Create .NET solution with three projects: Sifr.Client (Blazor WASM), Sifr.Server (ASP.NET Core Web API), Sifr.Shared (models).
2. Add CI workflow and basic README for running locally.
3. Implement core domain models: Transaction, Account, Invoice (records in Sifr.Shared).
4. Wire up API endpoints for basic CRUD and a placeholder reconciliation endpoint.
5. Add taskboard entries and assign initial tickets for core pieces.

Next steps
- Create solution and projects, then push branch 'implementation/start'.
